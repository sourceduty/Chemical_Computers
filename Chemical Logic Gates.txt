Chemical Logic Gates - Plain Text Diagrams
------------------------------------------

YES Gate (Identity)
-------------------
Logic: Y = A
Input:   A ——→ Output: Y
Chemistry: Single molecule A triggers a visible or measurable response.
Example: Fluorescent dye activated by A.

NOT Gate (Inverter)
-------------------
Logic: Y = NOT A
Input:   A ——|——→ Output: Y
Chemistry: Molecule A inhibits the output (e.g., by consuming an activator).
Example: A reduces pH, preventing fluorescence of a pH-sensitive dye.

AND Gate
--------
Logic: Y = A AND B
Inputs:  A ——┐
         B ——┴→ Output: Y
Chemistry: Both A and B are required to trigger product formation.
Example: Enzymatic system where A and B are substrates for a reaction that only occurs if both are present.

OR Gate
-------
Logic: Y = A OR B
Inputs:  A ——→┐
         B ——→┘ Output: Y
Chemistry: Either A or B alone can trigger the output.
Example: Two different reactants (A or B) can cause a color change in an indicator.

NAND Gate
---------
Logic: Y = NOT (A AND B)
Inputs:  A ——┐
         B ——┴→ [AND] ——|——→ Output: Y
Chemistry: Output is only inhibited if both A and B are present.
Example: Product formation from A and B triggers inhibitor that blocks signal.

NOR Gate
--------
Logic: Y = NOT (A OR B)
Inputs:  A ——→┐
         B ——→┘ [OR] ——|——→ Output: Y
Chemistry: If A or B is present, it prevents output.
Example: Any input molecule inhibits a reporter reaction.

XOR Gate
--------
Logic: Y = (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A AND B)
Inputs:  A ——┐       ┌——→ [AND] ——┐
         B ——┴→[NOT]→┘            │
              │                  ├──→ [OR] → Output: Y
         A ——→[NOT]→┐            │
         B ——┐       └——→ [AND] ——┘
Chemistry: Output only when exactly one of A or B is present.
Example: Competitive binding—only one molecule can activate the signal at a time.

XNOR Gate
---------
Logic: Y = (A AND B) OR (NOT A AND NOT B)
Inputs:  A ——┐       ┌——→ [AND] ——┐
         B ——┘       │            ├──→ [OR] → Output: Y
         A ——→[NOT]→┐            │
         B ——→[NOT]→┘——→ [AND] ——┘
Chemistry: Output when both inputs are the same.
Example: Symmetric chemical input creates a stable intermediate for output.
