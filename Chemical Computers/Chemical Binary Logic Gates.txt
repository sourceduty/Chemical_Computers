Chemical Logic Gates:

1. AND Gate:
   - Reaction: A + B → C
   - Output (C) is produced only when both A and B are present.

2. OR Gate:
   - Reaction: A → C, B → C
   - Output (C) is produced when either A or B (or both) are present.

3. NOT Gate (Inverter):
   - Reaction: A → X (where X inhibits C)
   - Output (C) is produced when A is absent.

4. NAND Gate:
   - Reaction: A + B → X (where X inhibits C)
   - Output (C) is produced unless both A and B are present.

5. NOR Gate:
   - Reaction: A → X, B → X (where X inhibits C)
   - Output (C) is produced only when neither A nor B is present.

6. XOR Gate:
   - Reaction: (A → C, B inhibits C) + (B → C, A inhibits C)
   - Output (C) is produced when either A or B is present, but not both.

7. XNOR Gate:
   - Reaction: (A + B → C) + (¬A + ¬B → C)
   - Output (C) is produced when A and B are either both present or both absent.

8. Buffer (Identity Gate):
   - Reaction: A → C
   - Output (C) is identical to input (A).

9. Half Adder (XOR + AND):
   - Sum: XOR(A, B) → S
   - Carry: AND(A, B) → C

10. Full Adder (XOR, AND, OR Combination):
   - Sum: XOR(A, XOR(B, Cin)) → S
   - Carry: OR(AND(A, B), AND(XOR(A, B), Cin)) → C

Note: Chemical species (A, B, C, X, etc.) represent reactants and products in a reaction network that implements Boolean logic.
