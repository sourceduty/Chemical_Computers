A chemical-based binary CPU in chemical computers operates using chemical reactions to perform binary computations, analogous to the way electronic CPUs rely on electric signals. In a chemical CPU, the binary states ("0" and "1") are represented by the presence or absence of specific chemical species, their concentration levels, or distinct reaction products. The chemical logic gates, like AND, OR, and NOT, are implemented through carefully designed reaction networks where reactants interact to produce outputs based on Boolean logic. For instance, in a chemical AND gate, two input chemicals must be present simultaneously to trigger the production of an output product. This system leverages autocatalytic reactions, oscillatory chemical systems (e.g., the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction), and enzymatic catalysis to facilitate computation without traditional electronic circuits.

The CPUâ€™s operations rely on a structured reaction-diffusion medium or microfluidic systems to control the flow, mixing, and timing of chemical reactions. These systems act as the equivalent of transistors and data buses, ensuring chemical signals propagate and interact accurately. Input values are encoded by introducing specific reactants or controlling initial conditions, while outputs are monitored via color changes, pH levels, or spectroscopic measurements. While slower compared to electronic processors, chemical-based CPUs are uniquely suited for environments where electronics fail, such as extreme temperatures or within biological systems. This opens pathways for chemical computers to excel in areas like molecular diagnostics, autonomous drug delivery, and soft robotics, where computations are embedded directly in reactive chemical networks.
