Chemical computing is an emerging interdisciplinary field that explores how chemical processes can perform computational tasks, offering alternatives to traditional silicon-based computing. At its core, chemical computing leverages chemical reactions, molecular systems, and reaction-diffusion dynamics to encode, process, and transfer information. Systems like chemical logic gates mimic electronic computation, where the presence or absence of reactants corresponds to binary states, enabling the execution of logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT. Examples include enzymatic reactions and DNA strand displacement systems, where molecules act as inputs, perform computations, and generate outputs. These systems demonstrate the potential of harnessing chemistry for parallel and energy-efficient information processing.

A particularly notable area is reaction-diffusion systems, where spatial and temporal chemical patterns are used to process information and solve complex problems. Inspired by biological systems, such as Turing patterns observed in morphogenesis, these reactions are used to implement cellular automata, synchronization mechanisms, and pattern recognition tasks. Oscillatory reactions like the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction are widely studied for their periodic behaviors, which can serve as chemical clocks or signal propagators. Furthermore, DNA computing has demonstrated the ability to solve computational problems, such as NP-hard graph problems, through molecular hybridization and strand displacement processes, showcasing the immense storage and parallel processing capabilities of DNA.

Applications of chemical computing span diverse fields, including solving NP-hard problems, developing self-healing materials, and designing soft robotics that rely on programmable chemical reactions for adaptability and movement. Chemical systems can also power biosensors capable of detecting environmental signals or toxins, while bio-inspired computation promises energy-efficient alternatives to conventional computing. Emerging research areas, such as chemical neural networks and programmable matter, highlight the potential for scalable, autonomous, and sustainable computational systems. By mimicking the efficiency and adaptability of natural processes, chemical computing offers revolutionary approaches to computation, fostering advancements in biotechnology, materials science, and artificial intelligence.
