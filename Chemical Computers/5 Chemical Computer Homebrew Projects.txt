1. Belousov-Zhabotinsky Reaction Maze Solver

This project utilizes the oscillatory nature of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction to model computational problem-solving, specifically pathfinding in mazes. In a petri dish filled with a gelatinous medium infused with BZ reagents, you can etch a maze pattern using hydrophobic barriers (e.g., wax or parafilm). By triggering the reaction at one end (input), wavefronts of chemical excitation propagate through the maze. Due to the reaction’s preference for shortest paths and inhibition zones from wave collisions, the chemical waves reveal optimal or near-optimal paths to the output site. Time-lapse imaging and digital analysis can be used to extract and interpret the result. This setup demonstrates parallel information processing and reaction-diffusion-based computation, and can be refined to simulate logic gates or spatial memory elements.

2. DIY DNA Strand Displacement Logic Circuits

Using inexpensive synthetic DNA oligos ordered online, you can build simple strand displacement systems that act like digital logic gates. By programming DNA sequences with toehold regions (short single-stranded overhangs), inputs can selectively displace pre-hybridized strands, releasing outputs in a highly specific, programmable manner. A home lab equipped with pipettes, a mini-centrifuge, and a simple fluorimeter (e.g., a smartphone-based setup with LED excitation and filters) is sufficient to build and monitor AND, OR, and NOT gates. Fluorescence readouts enable real-time observation of logical behavior. This project introduces principles of molecular programming and is an excellent gateway into synthetic biology and nanotechnology-based computation.

3. Chemical Automaton with pH Oscillators

Design a one-dimensional chemical cellular automaton using pH oscillators like the Bray–Liebhafsky reaction or modified BZ systems in agar or microdroplets. Each "cell" in the automaton is a compartmented volume or gel segment containing reagents that change color based on local pH shifts. By spatially coupling these cells via ion diffusion (for example, by embedding in a thin agar strip), pH changes propagate to neighbors according to rules akin to those in digital automata (e.g., Rule 110 or Conway’s Game of Life). Initial states can be programmed by selective addition of acid or base, and reaction dynamics can be monitored visually using pH indicators. This project highlights how simple chemical feedback can encode complex emergent behavior.

4. Biochemical Neural Net with Enzyme Logic

This project involves constructing an analog neural-like circuit using enzymatic reactions that mimic weighted summation and thresholding. By selecting enzyme-substrate pairs with tunable kinetics (e.g., glucose oxidase, urease, horseradish peroxidase), you can design a biochemical circuit where multiple inputs (substrates) contribute to a common output (e.g., colorimetric or electrochemical signal). Weights can be implemented by varying enzyme concentration or substrate affinities. Threshold behavior can be enforced with cooperative or sigmoidal enzymatic steps. This biochemical neural node can perform binary classification or signal integration tasks. Using microfluidics or droplet compartments, multiple nodes can be networked to explore rudimentary learning and sensing applications.

5. Ionic Memristor from Redox Gels

Inspired by the concept of memristive behavior in electronics, this project aims to build a chemical memory device using a redox-active gel, such as poly(vinyl alcohol) doped with potassium ferricyanide/ferrocyanide. When connected to electrodes, the gel exhibits resistance changes depending on redox state and history of applied current, simulating a memristor. You can fabricate the device in a petri dish or sandwich format with graphite electrodes and control it using an Arduino or Raspberry Pi for voltage application and readout. This system models history-dependent learning and could be used to build adaptive chemical circuits or study chemical synapses, bridging the gap between neuromorphic computing and materials chemistry.
