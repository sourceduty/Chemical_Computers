Chemical computing encompasses a diverse range of approaches that utilize chemical processes to perform computation, moving beyond traditional electronic paradigms. One foundational class involves chemical reaction-based computation, where logic and control are realized through the spatiotemporal dynamics of reactive systems. Reaction-diffusion computers are a prime example, employing chemicals such as those involved in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction to generate and manipulate patterns. These patterns, such as traveling chemical waves, can be engineered to interact and perform logical operations. Additionally, oscillatory chemical networks leverage periodic chemical reactions to encode temporal information, functioning as clocks or phase-based logic units. Researchers have also conceptualized chemical automata and chemical Turing machines, mapping classical computational models onto reaction networks that transition through defined chemical states.

At the molecular level, molecular information processing explores the use of specific biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins for computation. DNA computing, first demonstrated by Leonard Adleman in solving the Hamiltonian Path Problem, uses base-pairing rules and enzymatic reactions to represent and manipulate data. Complex computations are performed via strand displacement cascades and carefully designed reaction pathways. Protein- and peptide-based systems offer additional modes of computation through conformational changes and selective binding, encoding logical functions or memory states in biochemical interactions. Enzyme-based logic gates—systems where inputs are chemical substrates and outputs are reaction products—are capable of performing Boolean operations, and can be cascaded to form larger circuits. These systems are particularly promising for biosensing applications and smart therapeutics.

Beyond digital models, analog chemical computing offers a continuous, real-time approach to computation using chemical concentrations, pH changes, or redox states as signals. These systems naturally perform mathematical operations like integration, filtering, and feedback control, and are ideal for environments where discrete logic is impractical. Analog chemical computers are being explored in contexts such as soft robotics, where they can help process environmental cues, and in biosensors, where they offer autonomous signal processing capabilities. Such analog systems often involve feedback loops and dynamic equilibria, drawing inspiration from natural regulatory systems found in metabolic networks.

The field also intersects deeply with biology through bio-inspired and hybrid computing systems, which mimic or co-opt biological processes to build synthetic computational devices. Synthetic biocomputers use genetically engineered circuits within living cells to implement logic gates, switches, and memory. These intracellular systems can respond to chemical inputs and trigger specific cellular responses, offering a path toward programmable medicine. In neuromorphic chemical systems, the goal is to mimic brain-like architectures using chemical elements that replicate the behavior of neurons and synapses—often using ionic gradients, phase transitions, or reversible binding. Some systems also explore memristive behavior in chemical materials, where history-dependent responses enable learning and memory-like functions, akin to artificial neural networks.

Finally, the modeling and simulation of chemical computers rely heavily on formal abstractions such as chemical reaction networks (CRNs), which represent species and reactions as graphs for computational design. Deterministic models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used to study system kinetics, while stochastic methods like the Gillespie algorithm are essential for capturing behavior in systems with small numbers of molecules, where randomness plays a significant role. Simulation tools help researchers test reaction designs before implementation in wet labs, aiding in the development of stable, efficient computational chemistries. These modeling frameworks are central to advancing chemical computing as they enable integration with systems engineering, optimization, and control theory—paving the way for robust and scalable molecular computation.
